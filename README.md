# [Introduction to Robotics 2023-2024](https://github.com/iRaduS/IntroductionToRobotics)
Repository that servers all my homeworks and projects made during the "Introduction to Robotics" course at Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Scinence @ University of Bucharest. Each project or homework that will be posted here it will have its own documentation, images or even videos found inside the ```static``` directory.

## Homework 1
The first homework was to create this repository within the specified guidelines.

## [Homework 2](/hw2_rgbLedPotentiometer/)

The second homework was about creating a dimmable RGB led using three potentiometers that controls every color channel of the led. The homework working concept and circuit presentation can be found here [(click me)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8qvw5pMxZ8). The circuit diagram is represented here:
