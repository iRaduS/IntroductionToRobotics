# [Introduction to Robotics 2023-2024](https://github.com/iRaduS/IntroductionToRobotics)
Repository that servers all my homeworks and projects made during the "Introduction to Robotics" course at Faculty of Mathematics and Computer Scinence @ University of Bucharest. Each project or homework that will be posted here it will have its own documentation, images or even videos found inside the ```static``` directory.

## Homework 1
The first homework was to create this repository within the specified guidelines.

The second homework was about creating a dimmable RGB led using three potentiometers that controls every color channel of the led. The homework working concept and circuit presentation can be found here [(click me)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i8qvw5pMxZ8). The circuit diagram is represented here:

The third homework was about creating an elevator simulator using three rgb leds denoting the ground, first and second floor a status led for showing that the elevator is ascending or descending and also a buzzer to show when the lift is closing doors or is moving. BONUS! I used a 7-segment display to show the current floor of the lift. The demo of the homework can be found here [(click me)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bSqYU4KW1P0)

The fourth homework of the IoR course was to design a circuit that integrates a joystick which is used to draw across a 7 segment display. If the switch of the joystick is pressed then a segment on the display should be activated but if the switch is pressed for more than 3 seconds then the draw restarts and all the segments are given a reset. The demo of the homework can be found here [(click me)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs0YgoyrTTg)

The fifth homework of the IoR course was to design a circuit that integrates 4 digit 7 segment display, a shift registry and 3 buttons. The entire circuit should emulate a stopwatch that can register laps, reset and start from a lap. The demo of the homework can be found here [(click me)](https://youtu.be/0XIp1D5KkbA)
